📌 Project Overview

This project involves the design and simulation of a high-efficiency air-conditioning (HVAC) system capable of handling variable thermal loads, developed as part of Inter-IIT Tech Meet 13.0 (Low Prep Division).
The model integrates thermodynamic cycle simulation, heat-transfer optimization, and HVAC performance evaluation under fluctuating ambient conditions.

A performance-oriented cooling cycle was implemented using MATLAB/Simulink, supported by ANSYS physics-based CFD analysis and Python-based metric evaluation.
The system achieved an energy-efficiency improvement of ~12% during dynamic environmental load changes.
